### Basic Gameplay
The aim of the game is to score as high as you can.  To score you need to shoot down the boats with your weapons.

### Weapons
You have 3 unique weapons:  

**Pistol**  
    Overall good weapon.  Decent firerate and damage.  Infinite ammo. 
 
**SMG**  
    DPS god.  Insane firerate and dps.  Extremely limited ammo.
 
**Shotgun**  
    Power weapon.  Low firerate but high damage.  Decent ammunition.
### Blitz
The blue bar is your Blitz meter.  It represents your score multiplier.  However, it does a lot more than that.  When the Blitz meter reaches 3.0×, you can press ++x++ to unleash a superpowerful attack.  This costs you 2.0× multiplier but clears the screen and gives you invulnerability frames.  It essentially is a 'get out of jail' move.  

But be careful, using a Blitz will lower your multiplier, which lowers how fast you can get score.

#### Deathblitz
If you blitz within 0.15 seconds of getting hit, you can negate that damage.  If you miss this window, your blitz will only cost 1.5× multiplier.

### Graze
If a bullet just misses you, you get a small amount of score and score multiplier.  Actively trying to graze is risky but the rewards can build up to a noticable degree.
