# Making the website
This website is build using [mkdocs], from the folder called docs in the source directory. Simple as it may seem, it does have a few tricks up its sleeve.

## Autogenerated file docs

We're using JSDoc in most of the code, so we can put in a specially formatted comment like the one below, and turn it into [this](/source/primitives.js/).
```javascript
/**
 * A 2D Vector class. Very simple.
 * @param {number} x 
 * @param {number} y 
 */
```

I've done this with a bit of custom code that iterates over all of the files in the `src/` directory, turns the doc comments into
*markdown*, then puts that into the `docs/` folder. It's not perfect, but it does a pretty good job at helping us use our own functions
effectively. The only issue now is actually putting these doc comments in.

## The Blog
The section of the website you're looking at now is the *Blog*. You may have noticed that the posts are in the opposite order to 
what blog posts normally are in, and this is a deliberate choice. Because these posts are meant to be read in the order they were written,
it makes more sense to have the oldest ones at the top.
