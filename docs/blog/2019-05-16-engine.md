# Making the engine

Our game(s) are really just a bunch of classes pointing at each other. Does this really count as an engine? I have no clue!

At the beginning of the process, I planned to actually have a separate engine with a level editor, then I realised that we're not making anything that would really need a proper engine, and if we did we'd probably use a preexisting engine (maybe not idk i'm indecisive)

* [x] Waffle in the first paragraph

Instead of describing the process of making a game with out "engine", here's an extemely simple that does essentially bugger all

```typescript tab="menu.json"
{
    "title": "ballmouse",
    "games": [{
        "entry": "/dist/example.bundle.js",
        "title": "Example Game",
        "icon": "/assets/example/logo.png"
    }]
}
```

```typescript tab="example/entry.ts"
export default class example extends Game {
    root: Root = new Root;
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.el.width  = 720;
        this.el.height = 480;
    }
}
```

```typescript tab="example/root.js"
import {Entity} from "~/primitives";
import Player from "./player";

export default class ExampleRoot extends Entity {
    children: Array<Entity> = [new ExamplePlayer]
}
```

```typescript tab="example/player.js"
import {Entity} from "~/primitives";

export default class ExamplePlayer extends Entity {
    children: Array<Entity> = [new Sprite({
        src: "/assets/example/player.png"
    })]
}
```
