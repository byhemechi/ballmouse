Today, we created a basic framework for the game.  
We added basic jumping, as the player is locked on the x-axis, left-right movement is not needed for the player.  
We made sure the player could not jump infinitely by detecting whether or not the player was on the ground.  
Measuring the player's y position, we can make sure the player is actually touching the ground before they are allowed to jump.  
We added a sprite for the player, by attatching a child sprite to the player during initialisation.
