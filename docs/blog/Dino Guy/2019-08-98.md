Today, we finished off the minigame.  
We added a death and restart function, dying will set the game speed to 0, and lock the player's y axis.  
With the speed being 0, the cacti will stop moving and the player's rotation will stop.
The locking of the y axis will stop the player from jumping while dead.
The reset function deletes all of the remaining cacti and resets the player's score and position.

We added a score system with this update too.  
The player's distance travelled will be measured, a variable very similar to the cactus distance variable but without being reset.  
The distance will be divided by 10 in order for the score to increase a little more slowly.
