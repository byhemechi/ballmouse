Today, we decided on another minigame for our project.
Dino Guy, as we are going to call it, is going to be an endless runner in the style of the Google Chrome offline dinosaur game.

It is going to have enemy cacti, which will end the game when touched.
We will need to implement collision for the cacti, we will use AABB for the collision.
The speed of the game will also increase as you play, with higher scores making the game run faster.

We will be using the same techniques as we did in Flappy Guy to create this minigame, and we don't expect it to take very long to create.
