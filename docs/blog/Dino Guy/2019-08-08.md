# Day 3: Collision Detection

Today, we created a basic enemy for the player to avoid and added basic AABB collision.  
The enemy of this game are cacti, which the player 'moves' to and avoids.
Really, the cacti are moving towards the player on the x-axis.  
When they collide with the player, the player will die and the game will end.  
Cacti will spawn when the player has 'travelled' a specific ampunt affected by a small amount of randomness.  
When the player has travelled a random number of pixels between 400 and 1400, a cactus will spawn.  
The distance will then reset and a new distance before cactus will be set.

Collision will be simple AABB, where collision will be achieved if 4 conditions are met.  
The 4 conditions are as followed:  
When the x position of the player is less than the cacti's position plus its size;  
when the y position of the player is less than the cacti's position plus its size;  
when the x position of the cactus is less than the player's position plus its size;  
when the y position of the cactus is less than the player's position plus its size;  
When these conditions are met collision is achieved.  

We still need to implement a death and reset function into the game.
