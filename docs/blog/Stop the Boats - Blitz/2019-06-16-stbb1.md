# Day 1: Initialisation
**Author: Joon Suh**

On the first day of development, I started work on the basic components of the game.  The player and bullet class were created and worked on.

## Player Controller
On the first day the player controller had basic components added.  These included: 
- movement
- weapon systems
- shooting system
The player can be moved up and down using the arrow keys, and shooting can be done with the 'Z' key.  
### Movement functions
```javascript
// Determine movement direction
keyboardMove() {
    var move = 0;

    move -= this.game.keys.ArrowUp ? 1 : 0;
    move += this.game.keys.ArrowDown ? 1 : 0;

    return move;
}
// Clamp player position so they don't go off screen
clampPosition() {
    const border = 16;
    this.position.y = min(max(this.position.y, 0 + border), this.game.el.height - border);
}
```
## Weapon system
I also implimented a weapon class that contained data about how the weapon would behave.  Each weapon was an Object that would be added to a 'weapons' Array in the player with info about bullet speed, spread, size, damage, firerate, reload speed, magazine size, and more in the future.  

A new weapon can be created by creating a new 'Weapon' object and modifying its parameters.
### player.js
```javascript
new Weapon({
    speed: 1000,
    damage: 20,
    spread: 0.3,
    firerate: 0.02,
    magsize: 40,
    reloadtime: 4
})
```
## Bullet class

The other thing that I created was a bullet class.  At this state the bullet can only move and check if it is offscreen, but not delete itself or mark itself for recycling.  

### bullet.js
```javascript

// Runs every frame
tick(delta) {
    // Increment position by angle * speed
    this.position = this.position.add(
        new Vector(
            cos(this.angle), 
            sin(this.angle)
        ).multiply(this.speed * delta)
    )

    this.checkIfOffscreen();
    
    super.tick(delta);
}

checkIfOffscreen() {
    if (this.position.x > this.game.el.width ||
        this.position.x < 0 ||
        this.position.y > this.game.el.height ||
        this.position.y < 0) {
            // Deletion code goes here
    }
}
```
