# Day 5: Basic Gameplay + UI
#### Author: Joon Suh

Today I started work on the parts of the game that people actually care about instead of obsessing over continuous collision detection.  I added boats that spawn at currently a fixed interval.  The boats shoot at the player which damages you.  Currently, nothing happens when you lose all of your health.  The boats also use the same Weapon data structure as the player, which could help later on with compatability.

I also added some basic UI displaying the player's health and score.
