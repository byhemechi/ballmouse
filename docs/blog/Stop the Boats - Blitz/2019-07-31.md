# Day 8: Final Gameplay touches

Today I finished making balance changes to Stop the Boats.  I got my peers to playtest the game and give some feedback.

The general consensus was that the Blitz mechanic was way too powerful as you were able to spam it to constantly stay alive, despite the multiplier penalty I added.  I added a mechanic where boats defeated from a Blitz would not reward any multiplier bonus.  

I got the playtesters to try out the new system for some additional feedback.  While the new system did alleviate the issue a notable amount, it still had the issue of the cycle of "grind -> Blitz -> grind - Blitz" where you would just build up to 2.0x multiplier and Blitz, repeating forever without any consequence.  This did not fit my original intent of the Blitz mechanic, where you were supposed to be punished for using a Blitz by lowering your score multiplier.  I increased the cost of using a Blitz from 1.0 to 2.0 as so that you couldn't use your Blitz as often and it was also much more punishing to use than before.
