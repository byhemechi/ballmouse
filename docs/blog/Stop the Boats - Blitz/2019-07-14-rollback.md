# Day 4: Broken Collisions 
**Author: Joon Suh**

After playtesting the game, I noticed some erronous behaviour with the player-bullet collision.  If the bullet travelled at a steep angle towards the player the collision detection would go off earlier than it should have.  

After evaluating the issue and thinking of solutions, I decided that my original solution was unnessesarily complicated for the current project and decided to roll back to using basic circle collision.

The collision algorithm is simply:
```pascal
FOR EACH bullet IN enemyBullets
  IF (playerPositionX - bulletPositionX)^2 + (playerPositionY - bulletPositionY)^2 < radius^2 
    _PLAYERHIT_
  END IF
END FOR
```

The downside to this method from the previous method (if it worked properly, which it didn't) was that the new method did not support continuous collision detection.  This means that if the framerate dropped to a very low number, the enemy bullets could tunnel past the player and not damage them.

The aformentioned problem was also now no longer an issue as the engine was recently changed as so the "minimum" framerate was set to 30.  If the actual framerate dropped under 30 fps, the engine would still treat it as 30 fps and slowdown would occur, making bullet tunneling no longer an issue.
