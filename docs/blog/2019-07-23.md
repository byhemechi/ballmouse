A standing wave is a wave which apoears to be stationary.
It can be produced by a wave reflecting back and forth, producing nodes and antinodes.
Nodes are regions where particle displavement is zero due to destructive interference
Antinodes are regions where particle displacement (i.e. amplitude) is maximum as a result of constructive interference
