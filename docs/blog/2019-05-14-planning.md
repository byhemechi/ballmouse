# Planning out the game
For our group project, we had a large number of potential ideas. Something something
# Potential Games
##   JRPG
One of our potential ideas was a JRPG.  We quickly decided not to create this game for a multitude of reasons.  While they are not to difficult to program for, designing the gameplay and balancing it is ***VERY*** difficult.  
### Pros
- Not to hard to program
### Cons
- Hard to balance
- Boring 
## Unity terrain game
Another potential idea that we had was a Unity based terrain game.  This idea was immediately disregarded as a bad idea.  Unity terrain games are ***VERY*** easy to create, but they are also **fucking** boring.  
### Pros
- Easy to code
### Cons
- Boring
- Unoriginal
- Half the class is goung to do it
