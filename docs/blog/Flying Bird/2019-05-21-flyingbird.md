As our first game, we decided to start with a simple game to get familiar with our engine.  The first game that we agreed to create was a game that you travelled to the right whilst dodging obstacles.  The game was directly inspired by the mobile game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). 
## Planning
Before creating the game, we created a list of criteria that this game had to meet.  These were as following:
- The gameplay is dynamic
- The game does not suffer from slowdown/lag
- The game is bug free

A simple structure for the game was also created.
```pascal
START MAIN
TIME = 0
SPEED = 20
PIPES = []
SCREEN_RIGHT = 400
SCREEN_BOTTOM = 200

WHILE PLAYER.IS_ALIVE
  TIME += 1
  FOR EACH IN PIPES AS P
    IF P.COLLIDES(PLAYER)
      KILL_PLAYER()

  FOR EACH IN PIPES AS P
    P.MOVE_BY(SPEED)
    IF P.POSITION.X < 0
      P.FREE()
  
  IF TIME == 10
    CREATE NEW_PIPE
    NEW_PIPE.POSITION = 
                (SCREEN_RIGHT,
                 RANDOM(0, SCREEN_BOTTOM))
    PIPES.ADD(NEW_PIPE)
    TIME = 0

END MAIN
``` 
```pascal
START PLAYER
POSITION = 0
GRAVITY = 10
VELOCITY = 0

WHILE IS_ALIVE
  VELOCITY -= GRAVITY
  
  IF BUTTON_PRESSED('Space')
    VELOCITY = 10

  POSITION += VELOCITY

END PLAYER
```
### Time Management
Because the game was meant to be an exercise for using the engine, the time that it takes to create the game should be very short.  It should take use a week at most to complete the game.
