# Flying Guy: The Basics
As our first game, we decided to start with a simple game to get familiar with our engine.  The first game that we agreed to create was a game that you travelled to the right whilst dodging obstacles.  The game was directly inspired by the mobile game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird). 
## Gameplay
In 'Flying Guy' you have to navigate yourself around pipes which end the game when you touch them.  The further that you go, the higher your score will be.

To differentiate the game from being a direct clone of Flappy Bird, we decided to add a second gamemode.  The first gamemode will just be normal Flappy Bird, where you press a button to jump.

The second gamemode is partially inspired by a simillar mode in the game [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/) where you hold down jump to go up at a constant speed, and let go to go down at the same speed ([example](https://youtu.be/PQkAjNPKxDM?t=15)).

### Time Management
Because the game was meant to be an exercise for using the engine, the time that it takes to create the game should be very short.  It should take use a week at most to complete the game.
