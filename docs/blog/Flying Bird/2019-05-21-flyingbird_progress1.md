# Day 1: Initialisation
On the first day of development, we created a basic prototype of the game.
A large portion of the essential features were implemented, the player controller, pipe generation, and scoring was implemented.

However, the engine was not yet complete and did not support sprite rendering, so we used rectangles as placeholders for sprites.
