It is important for us to consider the potential impacts of our software.  Without proper considerations and safety measures, it could cause unwanted harm to the user.

One of the issues with games is that they are usually in the form of an executable.  This makes them much more vulnerable to being infected with malware and being spread alongside the game.  This could result in harmful malware spreading across different computers[^1].  

To partially avoid this potential issue, we created the engine as a web app.  This moves the dangerous safety responsibilities to the web browser developers, whom are much more experienced and knowlegeable in protection.  In the case that it is infected with malware, it reduces the risk of the game spreading malware as if we notice that our game is being hijacked, we can shut the servers down and stop the malware from spreading any further.
