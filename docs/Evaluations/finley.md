The development of our minigame collection was successful, with a good end product. We had project roles that mostly worked, and programming was on the simpler side.

The project roles are as followed: George would create the engine our games ran off and assist programming after that, Joon would be the main programmer for the games, and I would create assets and become a secondary programmer.

The plan worked well, workload was spread pretty evenly but there were problems balancing the workload.  
George created the engine as planned and assisted with the code as planned.
Joon was the main programmer on the games as planned but also coded some features of the engine as well.  
I created almost all of the assets and also created a game alongside Joon, but the game was unfortunately lost in a Git accident.

As main asset creator and secondary coder, I was responsible mainly for the creation of assets. I made sure to create a coherent artstyle and that was indeed a success.
I learnt a lot about javascript and typescript from this project as a secondary programmer, Joon and George taught me a lot about the languages.
I also learned a lot about git as well during this project, and how it is very important in group and even individual software projects.

The main problem I encountered was the loss of Dinoguy.  
The situation behind it is a small mystery, but I believe I may have accidentally staged a change to a file that broke the process of compiling the game at the end of the development process.  
We were unable to save Dinoguy in time, and I learned a lesson about being very careful of accidentally staging files on git.  

Overall, I learned a lot from this project and believe that our group worked decently well together creating a major software project.
